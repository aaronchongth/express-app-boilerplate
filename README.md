# Template Express app

Most of it is boilerplate code and project organization.

Currently uses `express`, `ejs`, `body-parser`.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronchongth/express-app-boilerplate

cd express-ejs-boilerplate
npm install

# To run node
npm start

# To run nodemon
npm run start:dev 
```

## Branching

Different branches will be further development of the templates and introducing other libraries.
