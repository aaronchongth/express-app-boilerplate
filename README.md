# Template Express app

Most of it is boilerplate code and project organization, similar to `express-generator` but with more personal preferences.

Mainly uses `express`, `ejs`, `body-parser` and other non-essential libraries.

## Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aaronchongth/express-app-boilerplate

cd express-app-boilerplate
npm install

# To run node
npm start

# To run nodemon
npm run start:dev 
```

## Branching

Different branches will be further development of the templates and introducing other libraries.

These branches might be referencing outdated libraries or CDNs, remember to update them when something goes wrong.
